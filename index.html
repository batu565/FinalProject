                    Himalayan peaks</h3>
                <p data-lang="news-content-4">The Nepalese army has said it has collected 11 tonnes of garbage, four
                    corpses and one skeleton from Mount Everest and two other Himalayan peaks this year. It took
                    soldiers 55 days to collect the garbage and bodies from Mount Everest, Nuptse and Lhotse. It is
                    estimated that there are more than 50 tonnes of garbage and 200 bodies on Everest. The clean-up
                    efforts on the mountain, often referred to as the ‘world’s highest garbage dump’, were launched in
                    2019 after concerns about crowds and dangerous conditions as climbers lined up to reach the summit.
                    The army said that a total of 119 tonnes of garbage, 14 corpses and some skeletons were brought back
                    in five clean-up operations. Content Video - The much-talked-about footage! Gang members searched
                    half-naked faint Authorities hope to reduce litter this year and have climbers wear tracking devices
                    to facilitate rescue operations and have climbers bring their own excrement from the summit. Rakesh
                    Gurung, director of the Nepal Mountaineering Tourism Corporation, told the BBC that the government
                    plans to set up mountain patrols to monitor litter in the future and allocate more financial
                    resources. The government issued permits to climb the summit to 421 climbers during the spring
                    climbing season, which ended in May. Last year, a record was broken when 478 were issued. That
                    number does not include Nepalese guides. An estimated 600 people have climbed the mountain this
                    year. Eight climbers have also died or gone missing this year. Last year, the number was 19. Gurung
                    said the number of permits to climb the summit had fallen due to the global economic downturn. China
                    issuing permits and elections in India have also contributed to the decline. The number is expected
                    to fall further after the Nepalese Supreme Court ordered the government to reduce the number of
                    permits.</p>
